  <p>I was born in New Orleans, LA and grew up spending most of my time in, on, near the water. Like a true Cajun, I enjoy good music and good food. I enjoy cooking, fishing, gardening,
    and spending time with my family.

  <p>I got a Ph.D. from Emory University studying molecular neuroscience. Specifically, I researched the molecular and cellular mechanisms that control the processes of myelin formation
    and repair. In graduate school, I uncovered new mechanisms that regulate the functions and interaction of an important enzyme in brain development and an RNA-binding protein that is a
    master regulator of myelin development. In the research after my Ph.D., I discovered that a cellular recycling process known as autophagy is critical for myelin formation, which is a 
    process that we still do not understand well. This was the first connection between autophagy and myelin and a rare occurance in which a cellular process could be manipulated to boost
    myelin formation.
